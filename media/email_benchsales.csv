Project Description:

*	Finch for Text is a text analytics platform that can extract, disambiguate, and enrich entities.
*	found in unstructured text. It uses natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence.
*	(AI), machine learning (ML) and proprietary algorithms to deliver accuracy at scale and in
*	real-time. It also performs sentiment assignment, text classification and text summarization.

Project #1

*	Using Transformers Hugging face architecture, trained Distil Roberta model for FNC topics mention level and sentence level sentiment.
*	Used masking techniques to effectively train the model for higher F1 scores.
*	Tested model extensively with Finch For text Service and improved the quality by clean lab and label Studio tagging techniques.
*	Created guidelines for taggers on FNC topics and relation extraction.
*	Also used co-reference resolution techniques to handle pronouns in the finch for text.

Project #2

TRSS Relation Extraction: 

*	Using Transformers Hugging face architecture, trained LUKE model for relation types requested by the client.
*	Collected Public domain Labelled dataset and fine-tuned model with several rounds of manual tagging.
*	Tested model extensively with Finch For text Service and improved the quality by snorkel labelling techniques.
*	Used distant learning, active learning techniques to fine tune training data by allowing the data set up on Label studio for manual reviews.
*	Also used co-reference resolution techniques to handle pronouns in the finch for text.

Project #3:                                   

IPTC news Channel node Detector:

*	Used different types of classifiers both machine learning and user defined classifiers by feeding relevant key phrases into the corpus.
*	Few of the classifiers used were pattern classifiers, word form classifiers, logistic regression etc. Used snorkel labelling functions to create pipelines for good quality corpus.

Project #4:

DAU tagger: 

*	Using topic modeling, created an app to identify the document user is searching for given a sentence to point to the right place from the huge collection of libraries.
*	Used different types of classifiers both machine learning and user defined classifiers by feeding relevant key phrases into the corpus.
*	Implemented labelling techniques rubrix/clean lab, Bokeh extensively to create the good, labelled train data to create the models that gave best F1 scores and good recalls.  
*	Used AWS Sagemaker to test some of the capabilities of the models that were developed.
*	Used AWS Sagemaker to quickly build, train and deploy the models.
